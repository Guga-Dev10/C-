Hello, world! Good afternoon

	My name is Gustavo, I have 25 years old and I live in Brazil with my parents. 
They are married for 30 years and they are living with me and I live with them. My sibilings
live with us, my brother has 23 years old and my sister has 16 years old. We live in a small coast
city called Mongagu√°, state of SP, Brazil, obviously hehehe.
	Our city has a population of sixty thousand peoples living here, but we are in a turism area
because of the coast, and the coast has a beach, hehe but I do not like so much the beach and the city.
