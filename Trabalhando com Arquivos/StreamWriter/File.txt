Hello, world! Good afternoon

	My name is Gustavo, I have 25 years old and I live in Brazil with my parents. 
They are married for 30 years and they are living with me and I live with them. My sibilings
live with us, my brother has 23 years old and my sister has 16 years old. We live in a small coast
city called Mongagu√°, state of SP, Brazil, obviously hehehe.
	Our city has a population of sixty thousand peoples living here, but we are in a turism area
because of the coast, and the coast has a beach, hehe but I do not like so much the beach and the city.
	Whatever!! The, uhh the city income four times more citizens living here in the high season in summer on
december, january and february and sometimes this situation extent until march's end. By the way, it is a good place for
elderly people live, because it has a beautiful nature and the weather is warm along of the year.
